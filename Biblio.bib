In this work, we apply the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the chip formation process within a thermo-mechanically coupled framework. A series of cutting experiments on two widely-used workpiece materials, i.e., AISI 1045 steel and Ti6Al4V titanium alloy, is conducted for validation purposes. Furthermore, we present a novel technique to measure the rake face temperature without manipulating the chip flow within the experimental framework, which offers a new quality of the experimental validation of thermal loads in orthogonal metal cutting. All material parameters and friction coefficients are identified in-situ, proposing new values for temperature-dependent and velocity-dependent friction coefficients of AISI 1045 and Ti6Al4V under the cutting conditions. Simulation results show that the choice of friction coefficient has a higher impact on SPH forces than FEM. Average errors of force prediction for SPH and FEM were in the range of 33\% and 23\%, respectively. Except for the rake face temperature of Ti6Al4V, both SPH and FEM provide accurate predictions of thermal loads with 5{\textendash}20\% error.},

The serrated chip formation of AISI 316L has a major impact on the periodic loads acting on the cutting tool. Therefore, it is vital to correctly model this serrated chip formation. One of the major difficulties with FE-simulations of metal cutting is that the extreme deformations in the workpiece material, often leads to a highly distorted mesh. This paper uses the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) formulation in Abaqus/Explicit, where the workpiece is modelled with the Eulerian formulation and the cutting tool by the Lagrangian one. This CEL formulation enables to completely avoid mesh distortion. To capture the chip serration process, the workpiece material is described with the Johnson-Cook damage model. The FE-simulation results are validated via comparison of the modelled cutting forces, chip serration frequency, and contact length against experimental ones.},

  abstract = {A damage evolution law is proposed to consider the frictional behavior within an Eulerian material after full damage as a Lagrangian material, where the mesh explicitly describes the newly born interface interactions. This approach is prominent for simulating severe plastic deformation (SPD) processes during which material separation can occur. Among these, orthogonal cutting represents the simplest process for comparison with the simulation because it offers accessibility for measuring physical quantities in situ in the vicinity of the tool. Therefore, a numerical model based on a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation to simulate segmented chip formation mechanisms during orthogonal cutting was developed. A simple damage initiation criterion was used, and the damage evolution criterion was coded in the ABAQUS subroutine VUSDFLD. The model can simulate both segmented and continuous chip formation, depending on the experimental configuration, while satisfactorily predicting chip morphology and physical quantities such as temperature, primary shear band and cutting forces. Additionally, a non-negligible material side flow observed experimentally was successfully predicted by simulation. The model accuracy in predicting the material plastic behavior is auspicious for its subsequent extension to the three-dimensional model of SPD processes (i.e., milling, friction stir welding, etc.).},

This paper includes contributions from academia and industry, and is expected to serve as a comprehensive report of recent progress, as well as a roadmap for future directions. Process models often target the prediction of fundamental variables such as stresses, strains, strain-rates, temperatures etc. However, to be useful to industry, these variables must be correlated to performance measures: product quality (accuracy, dimensional tolerances, finish, etc.), surface and subsurface integrity, tool-wear, chip-form/breakability, burr formation, machine stability, etc. The adoption of machining models by industry critically depends on the capability of a model to make this link and predict machining performance. Therefore, this paper would identify and discuss several key research topics closely associated with predictive model development for machining operations, primarily targeting industry applications.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 4.0, the process design and development of machining processes poses major challenges for today's manufacturing technology. Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical "trial-and-error" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 \%. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.},

One of the main machining characteristics of titanium alloys is to produce segmented chips for a wide range of cutting speeds and feeds. The present study assumes that the chip segmentation is only induced by adiabatic shear banding, without material failure in the primary shear zone. The new developed model takes into account the influence of strain, strain rate and temperature on the flow stress and also introduces a strain softening effect. The tool chip friction is managed by a combined Coulomb{\textendash}Tresca friction law. The influence of two different strain softening levels and machining parameters on the cutting forces and chip morphology has been studied.

However, constitutive models are not always available and simulation of cutting processes with complex tool geometries can lead to extensive computation time. This article presents an approach to determine constitutive parameters of the Johnson-Cook's flow stress model by inverse modelling as well as a methodology to predict process forces and temperatures for complex three-dimensional tools using Oxley's machining theory. In the first part of this study, an analytically based computer code combined with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to identify constitutive models for 70MnVS4 and an aluminium-alloyed ultra-high-carbon steel (UHC-steel) from orthogonal milling experiments. In the second part, Oxley's predictive machining theory is coupled with a multi-dexel based material removal model. Contact zone information (width of cut, undeformed chip thickness, rake angle and cutting speed) are calculated for incremental segments on the cutting edge and used as input parameters for force and temperature calculations. Subsequently, process forces are predicted for machining using the inverse determined constitutive models and compared to actual force measurements. The suggested methodology has advantages regarding the computation time compared to finite element analyses.},

Advanced physics-based plasticity models usually feature numerous internal variables (often of tensorial nature) along with a set of evolution equations and complementary conditions. In the present work, an attempt is made to come up with a machine-learning based model that can replicate the predictions anisotropic Yld2000-2d model with homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH). For this, a series of modeling problems of increasing complexity is formulated and sequentially addressed using neural network models. It is demonstrated that basic fully-connected neural network models can capture the characteristic non-linearities in the uniaxial stress-strain response such as the Bauschinger effect, permanent softening or latent hardening. A neural network with gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully-connected layer is proposed for the modeling of plane stress plasticity for arbitrary loading paths. After training and testing the model through comparison with the Yld2000-2d/HAH model, the recurrent neural network model is also used to model the multi-axial stress-strain response of a two-dimensional foam. Here, the comparison with the results from unit cell simulations provided another validation of the proposed data-driven modeling approach.},

In this paper a new constitutive relationship is established by modifying the Zerilli-Armstrong model based on the concept of dislocation mechanics. The efficacy of the proposed model has been demonstrated by implementing it as a constitutive law for Inconel 718, a nickel based super alloy. The constitutive data generated by using the distributed primary zone deformation model is utilised for calculating the material constants. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated by using a three-pronged evaluation process. The first evaluation procedure involved comparing flow stress predictions made by the proposed model with data generated by the distributed primary zone deformation model. The second evaluation process involved finite element simulations of the orthogonal machining process with the proposed material model as the constitutive relation. A user material subroutine is used for implementing the proposed constitutive relation into a finite element model of orthogonal machining process through ABAQUS/Explicit platform.

  abstract = {The manufacturing industry is confronted with increasing demands for digitalization. To realize a digital twin of the cutting process, an increase of the model reliability of the virtual representation becomes necessary. Thereby, different models are required to represent the experimental behavior of the workpiece material or frictional interactions. One of the most utilized material models is the Johnson{\textendash}Cook material model. The material model parameters are determined either by conventional or by non-conventional material tests, or inversely from the cutting process. However, the inverse parameter determination, where the model parameters are iteratively modified until a sufficient agreement between experimental and numerical results is reached, is not robust and requires a high number of iterations. In this paper, an approach for the inverse determination of material model parameters based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented. The approach was investigated by the inverse re-identification of an initial parameter set. The conducted investigations showed that a material model parameter set can be determined within a small number of iterations. Thereby, the determined material model parameters resulted in deviations of approximately 1\% in comparison to their target values. It was shown that the PSO is suitable for the inverse material parameter determination from cutting simulations.},

  abstract = {Modeling the machining process by means of simulation techniques became more and more popular within the last decades. The increasing use of simulation techniques can be attributed to the enhancing computational performance. To accurately model the machining process, different input models are required. Among them, the material model has a crucial impact on the quality of the simulated results. To determine the underlying material model parameters, an inverse procedure has been established, where the material model parameters are adjusted within a chip formation simulation until a reasonable match between simulations and experiments is achieved. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to determine material model parameters inversely from FE-machining simulations by means of the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm. An effect study was conducted to investigate the influence of the initial simplex, the boundary conditions, and the underlying parameters of the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm. Further, the validated procedure has been extended to consider multiple cutting conditions and an adaptive step-size has been implemented into the algorithm. The results of the procedure were validated by re-identification of process observables from the target simulations and it was aimed to re-identify the material model parameters of the target simulations. Based on the algorithm, a robust and systematical method has been developed to determine material model parameters inversely from the machining process.},

In this study, a FE-model of face turning is presented, wherefore the Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation is used. The computational time of the simulations was reduced to approximately 6 h, which allowed a time-efficient use of FE-simulations to analyze the face turning process. The results of the simulations are evaluated by comparing them with corresponding experimental cutting tests. The comparison of the results revealed a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental cutting forces, whereas the simulated passive and feed force deviated to a larger extend from the experimental counterparts.},

Current practice in industry is to machine and change tools conservatively, or to conduct costly empirical studies for a limited selection of tools and coolants. The Assessment of Machining Models project will assess the ability of modern machining models to predict the outputs of machining processes based upon a consistent, well measured calibration data set. The data set is nearly complete and is to be used in benchmarking the predictive capability of machining models in blind tests.

To provide a reference for researchers who are studying the potential application of computational intelligence in springback research, a review of studies into the development of sheet metal forming and the application of neural network to predict springback is presented in this research paper. It can be summarized as: (1) Springback is influenced by various factors that are involved in the sheet metal forming process. (2) The main complexity in FE analysis is the development of a constitutive model of a material that has the potential to be solved by using the computational intelligence approach.

  abstract = {Titanium alloy Ti6Al4V is the most commonly used titanium alloy in the aerospace and medical device industries due to its superior properties. There has been a considerable amount of research to better understand the serrated chip formation mechanism of titanium alloy Ti6Al4V by using finite element simulation of machining. An accurate representation of the behavior of the material is important in order to obtain reliable results from the finite element simulation. Flow softening behavior has been integrated into the material constitutive models to simulate adiabatic shear bands and serrated chips. Flow softening is usually related to the dynamic recrystallization phenomenon which initiates after a critical temperature. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of various flow softening conditions on the finite element simulation outputs for machining titanium alloy Ti6Al4V. For this purpose, a new flow softening expression, which allows defining temperature-dependent flow softening behavior, is proposed and integrated into the material constitutive model. The influence of flow softening below the critical temperature, as adopted in recent studies, is also investigated. Various temperature-dependent flow softening scenarios are tested using finite element simulations, and the results are compared with experimental data from the literature. The results showed that the flow softening initiating around 350{\textendash}500{\textdegree}C combined with appropriate softening parameters yields simulation outputs that agree well with the experimental measurements.},

This study proposes a new efficient approach consisting of a combined numerical-empirical methodology for inversely identifying the thermomechanical material behavior of AISI 316L stainless steel from machining experiments. In order to establish the work material's flow stress properties under the extreme conditions of machining, the Johnson{\textendash}Cook (JC) constitutive equation is chosen to consider the impacts of strain, strain-rate, and temperature. Due to the unstable material behavior of AISI 316L stainless steel under certain thermomechanical conditions in the primary shear zone, the calibration of a damage model is integrated into the process for evaluating the flow stress data. The methodology approximates the material constants of the JC relationship by systematically comparing experimentally measured machining results with those predicted equivalents of a 2D implicit FEM process model. The methodology is experimentally verified on AISI 316L stainless steel with respect to cutting forces, chip geometries and temperatures in the tool-chip interface.},

  abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence and increasing high-speed computational performance is still not fully explored in the field of numerical modeling and simulation of machining processes. The efficiency of the numerical model to predict the observables depends on various inputs. The most important and challenging inputs are the material behavior of the work material and the friction conditions during the cutting operation. The parameters of the material model and the friction model have a decisive impact on the simulated results. To reduce the expensive experimentation cost that gives limited data for the parameters, an inverse methodology to identify the parameter values of those inputs is suggested to potentially have data of better quality. This paper introduces a novel approach for the inverse identification of model parameters by implementing the Efficient Global Optimization algorithm. In this work, a method relying on a complete automated Finite Element simulation-based optimization algorithm is implemented to inversely identify the value of the Johnson{\textendash}Cook (JC) parameters and Coulomb's friction coefficient correlatively, where the objective function is defined as minimizing the error difference between experimental and numerical results. The Ti6Al4V Grade 5 alloy material is considered as a work material, and the identified parameters sets are validated by comparing the simulated results with experimental results. The developed automation process reduces the computation time and eliminating human errors. The identified model parameters value predicts the cutting force as 169 N/mm (2\% deviation from experiments), feed force as 55 N/mm (7\% deviation from experiments), and chip thickness as 0.150 mm (11\% deviation from experiments). Overall, the identified model parameters set improves the prediction accuracy of the finite element model by 32\% compared with the best-identified parameters set in the literature.},

A flow stress model based on process dependent parameters such as strain, strain-rate and temperature was used together with a friction model based on shear flow stress of the workpiece at the chip{\textendash}tool interface. High-speed cutting experiments and process simulations were utilized to determine the unknown parameters in flow stress and friction models. This technique was applied to obtain flow stress for P20 mold steel at hardness of 30 HRC and friction data when using uncoated carbide tooling at high-speed cutting conditions. The average strain, strain-rates and temperatures were computed both in primary (shear plane) and secondary (chip{\textendash}tool contact) deformation zones. The friction conditions in sticking and sliding regions at the chip{\textendash}tool interface are estimated using Zorev's stress distribution model. The shear flow stress (kchip) was also determined using computed average strain, strain-rate, and temperatures in secondary deformation zone, while the friction coefficient ({$\mu$}) was estimated by minimizing the difference between predicted and measured thrust forces. By matching the measured values of the cutting forces with the predicted results from FEM simulations, an expression for workpiece flow stress and the unknown friction parameters at the chip{\textendash}tool contact were determined.},

Nevertheless, the application of these methods to new materials requires the identification and implementation of constitutive and flow laws within FE codes, which sometimes pose problems, particularly because of the strongly non-linear character of the behavior of these materials. Computational techniques based on machine learning and artificial neural networks are becoming more and more important in the development of these models and help the FE codes to integrate more complex behavior. In this paper, we present the development, implementation and use of an artificial neural network (ANN) based flow law for a GrC15 alloy under high temperature thermomechanical solicitations. The flow law modeling by ANN shows a significant superiority in terms of model prediction quality compared to classical approaches based on widely used Johnson{\textendash}Cook or Arrhenius models.

First, we present the general structure of the neural network, its operation and focus on the ability of the network to deduce, without prior learning, the derivatives of the flow law with respect to the model inputs. In order to validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model, we compare and analyze the performance of several network architectures with respect to the analytical formulation of a Johnson{\textendash}Cook behavior law for a 42CrMo4 steel. In a second part, after having selected an Artificial Neural Network architecture with 2 hidden layers, we present the implementation of this model in the Abaqus Explicit computational code in the form of a VUHARD subroutine. The predictive capability of the proposed model is then demonstrated during the numerical simulation of two test cases: the necking of a circular bar and a Taylor impact test. The results obtained show a very high capability of the ANN to replace the analytical formulation of a Johnson{\textendash}Cook behavior law in a finite element code, while remaining competitive in terms of numerical simulation time compared to a classical approach.},

  abstract = {Finite Element Modelling used to predict machining outcomes needs to be supplied with the appropriate material thermomechanical properties which are obtained by specific testing devices and methodologies. However, these tests are usually not representative of the extreme conditions achieved in machining processes and the obtained material law may not be suitable enough. Inverse identification could address this problem by obtaining material thermomechanical properties directly from machining outcomes such as cutting forces, temperatures, strain or strain rates. Nevertheless, this technique needs to be supplied with accurate machining outcomes. However, some of them such as strain or strain rate are difficult to be properly measured. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to measure plastic strain and strain rate during orthogonal machining under plane strain conditions. The main idea is to create a physical microgrid in a workpiece and to analyze the distortion suffered by this grid. The novelty of the method consists on its capability of measuring strain and strain rate fields in a very localized area (primary shear zone) using a single image. The methodology was applied in orthogonal cutting of Ti-6Al-4V under cutting conditions that are representative of the broaching process. Experimental results were compared with DIC measurements, analytical results based on unequal division shear zone model, literature results and with numerical fields obtained from an AdvantEdge-2D model.},

  abstract = {A high temperature split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test system is used to investigate the effects of temperature as well as those of strain and strain-rate. Effects of temperature for the titanium alloy (Ti{\textendash}6Al{\textendash}4V) are investigated by developing a high temperature SHPB test system. In this work, high temperatures greater than 1000{\textdegree}C are attained in the SHPB test specimens by using two ellipsoidal radiant heating reflectors with two halogen lamps. The thermal gradients in the specimens are observed as they are heated. Methods for solving problems related to conduction between the specimens and elastic bars and techniques for measuring the temperature of the specimens are suggested. When testing with the high-temperature SHPB apparatus, care is required to prevent oxidation of the surface of the specimen, and to prevent an inhomogeneous temperature distribution from developing in the specimen. To determine the true flow stress{\textendash}true strain relationship, specimens are tested from room temperature to 1000{\textdegree}C at intervals of 200{\textdegree}C and at a strain-rate of 1400s-1. The parameters for a Johnson{\textendash}Cook constitutive equation and a modified Johnson{\textendash}Cook constitutive equation are determined from the test results. The modified Johnson{\textendash}Cook constitutive equation is more suitable for expressing the dynamic behavior of the Ti{\textendash}6Al{\textendash}4V titanium alloy in the vicinity of the recrystallization temperature.},

  abstract = {The plastic behaviour of material can be described using parametric material models such as the Johnson{\textendash}Cook model. The parameters for such models are identified from experimentally determined flow curves by curve fitting techniques. In high speed machining processes, one encounters strains of more than 200\% and strain rates of the order of 106s-1 or more in the shear zone. The material parameters are determined from experimental data obtained at much milder conditions and thus cannot be reliably used for simulating high speed cutting processes. The Johnson{\textendash}Cook material model is one of the simplest models with five parameters, which can describe the material behaviour at high temperatures, high strains, and high strain-rates and is often used in machining simulations. It has been shown earlier that multiple sets of Johnson{\textendash}Cook parameters may be found which can give rise to similar adiabatic stress{\textendash}strain curves. It has also been shown that by using these parameter sets for the finite element simulation, chip geometry, stress distribution, temperature distribution, and cutting forces are almost identical. In this paper a method for inverse identification of Johnson Cook parameters based on the Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt search algorithm is presented. An idealised finite element model for high speed machining is created, using a particular set of Johnson{\textendash}Cook parameters to describe the material behaviour. The aim of the inverse identification method is to re-identify the original Johnson{\textendash}Cook parameter set by looking at the chip morphology and the cutting force. In the idealised high speed cutting model, the clearance angle has been assumed to be zero and chip segmentation does not occur.},

In this study, influence of material constitutive models and elastic{\textendash}viscoplastic finite element formulation on serrated chip formation for modeling of machining Ti{\textendash}6Al{\textendash}4V titanium alloy is investigated. Temperature-dependent flow softening based modified material models are proposed where flow softening phenomenon, strain hardening and thermal softening effects and their interactions are coupled. Orthogonal cutting experiments have been conducted with uncoated carbide (WC/Co) and TiAlN coated carbide cutting tools. Temperature-dependent flow softening parameters are validated on a set of experimental data by using measured cutting forces and chip morphology. Finite Element simulations are validated with experimental results at two different rake angles, three different undeformed chip thickness values and two different cutting speeds. The results reveal that material flow stress and finite element formulation greatly affects not only chip formation mechanism but also forces and temperatures predicted. Chip formation process for adiabatic shearing in machining Ti{\textendash}6Al{\textendash}4V alloy is successfully simulated using finite element models without implementing damage models.},

The process characteristics of practical relevance are not only the cutting forces and the tool wear, but also the surface layer states of the machined part. In order to predict and to improve these characteristics efficiently, chip forming simulation via finite element method (FEM) is commonly applied. However, an issue in machining simulation which is often addressed is choosing appropriate material parameters for the flow stress model. This especially accounts for AISI4140 with various tempering conditions, as in many cases the precise heat treatment is not supplied in detail, even in scientific literature. In this work, orthogonal cutting of AISI4140 with tempering temperatures of 300{\textdegree}C, 450{\textdegree}C and 600{\textdegree}C is investigated by experiments and FE simulations. The Johnson-Cook flow stress model is used in the FE simulation. The referring material parameters for the tempering conditions are iteratively adapted via numerical optimization to fit experimental cutting forces. The obtained parameters are compared to literature values in order to prepare a common ground for the cutting simulation of AISI4140. This contributes to an enhanced process modelling when machining AISI4140 with use-case adapted heat treatments.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel and thorough approach to comprehending and simulating the DRX process while hot compressing steel. To achieve this goal, we studied the high-temperature deformation behavior of a medium-carbon steel through hot compression testing on a Gleeble-3800 thermomechanical simulator over a broad range of strains, strain rates, and temperatures. We also employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the thermo-visco-plastic behavior with a flow law. The precision of quantifying the DRX volume fraction is dependent on critical conditions, which are essential for both analytical model evaluation and numerical implementation in finite element software. This study proposes a second ANN, serving as a universal approximator, to fit the data required for DRX critical condition calculations, whereas the Johnson{\textendash}Mehl{\textendash}Avrami{\textendash}Kohnogorov (JMAK) model served as an analytical tool to estimate the DRX volume fraction, which underwent validation through experimental measurements. A numerical implementation of the JMAK model was conducted in ABAQUS software and compared against experimental data by means of microstructure analysis. The comparison revealed a strong correlation between the simulation and experiment. The study investigated the impact of temperature, strain, and strain rate on DRX evolution. The findings showed that DRX increases with rising temperature and strain but decreases with increasing strain rate.},

The ANN model showed excellent agreement between the predicted and experimental flow curves, with an error of less than 0.62\%. To validate the performance, the ability to interpolate and extrapolate the experimental data was also tested. The Hansel{\textendash}Spittel, PTM, and Arrhenius models showed good interpolation and extrapolation capabilities. However, the ANN model was the most-powerful of all the models.},

  abstract = {Within the process chain for the production of highly stressed components, finishing is of particular importance - the resulting surface layer properties of the workpiece decisively determine the component functionality. According to the concept of Process Signatures proposed by Brinksmeier and others, in the present work the internal material loads and the resulting material modifications are analyzed for milling of quenched and tempered 42CrMo4 (AISI 4140). 3D finite element simulations were conducted utilizing the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) method for which remeshing can be omitted. This is u.a. because the stresses during the process can not be measured in the required temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, in this work, 3D finite element simulations are used to investigate the influence of repetitive stress on hard milling. The formation of stresses at variable tooth feed, but with constant cutting speed and depth of cut is investigated. The development of material modifications (residual stresses) due to multiple stresses was determined and compared with experimental results. Results from the simulation show good accuracy in comparison with the experimentally determined cutting force and active force. The use of the CEL method in the simulation of milling allows us to determine the stresses in sufficient spatial and temporal resolution without the use of remeshing},

The explicit Finite Element solution method has been used to model this multi-pass spinning process. Effects of mass scaling and reduced integration linear element used in the FE simulation have been evaluated by using various energy histories obtained from the FE analysis. The numerical results suggest that among three tool force components the axial force is the highest while the tangential force is the lowest. Certain correlations have been found between the FE analysis results and measured dimensions of the spun part. The blank thickness decreases after each forward pass and there are almost no thickness changes during the backward pass. Stress distributions of the local forming zone of the workpiece in both forward and backward passes have also been analysed, which gives an insight into the material deformation during the spinning process.},

This cutting model includes a proposed constitutive model considering the strain hardening, strain-rate, temperature and stress state (e.g., stress triaxiality and Lode parameter) in the material plasticity and damage. This machining model is able to simulate the phenomenon of material side flow, which results in a larger chip width when compared to the width of cut and the lateral burr formation. The phenomenon of material side flow is validated by experimental results. The distribution of plastic strain and stress state shows that the workpiece transforms from plane strain state in middle surface to plane stress state in lateral surface, which finally results in the formation of lateral burr.},
