In this work, we apply the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the chip formation process within a thermo-mechanically coupled framework. A series of cutting experiments on two widely-used workpiece materials, i.e., AISI 1045 steel and Ti6Al4V titanium alloy, is conducted for validation purposes. Furthermore, we present a novel technique to measure the rake face temperature without manipulating the chip flow within the experimental framework, which offers a new quality of the experimental validation of thermal loads in orthogonal metal cutting. All material parameters and friction coefficients are identified in-situ, proposing new values for temperature-dependent and velocity-dependent friction coefficients of AISI 1045 and Ti6Al4V under the cutting conditions. Simulation results show that the choice of friction coefficient has a higher impact on SPH forces than FEM. Average errors of force prediction for SPH and FEM were in the range of 33\% and 23\%, respectively. Except for the rake face temperature of Ti6Al4V, both SPH and FEM provide accurate predictions of thermal loads with 5\textendash 20\% error.},

The serrated chip formation of AISI 316L has a major impact on the periodic loads acting on the cutting tool. Therefore, it is vital to correctly model this serrated chip formation. One of the major difficulties with FE-simulations of metal cutting is that the extreme deformations in the workpiece material, often leads to a highly distorted mesh. This paper uses the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) formulation in Abaqus/Explicit, where the workpiece is modelled with the Eulerian formulation and the cutting tool by the Lagrangian one. This CEL formulation enables to completely avoid mesh distortion. To capture the chip serration process, the workpiece material is described with the Johnson-Cook damage model. The FE-simulation results are validated via comparison of the modelled cutting forces, chip serration frequency, and contact length against experimental ones.},

  abstract = {A damage evolution law is proposed to consider the frictional behavior within an Eulerian material after full damage as a Lagrangian material, where the mesh explicitly describes the newly born interface interactions. This approach is prominent for simulating severe plastic deformation (SPD) processes during which material separation can occur. Among these, orthogonal cutting represents the simplest process for comparison with the simulation because it offers accessibility for measuring physical quantities in situ in the vicinity of the tool. Therefore, a numerical model based on a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation to simulate segmented chip formation mechanisms during orthogonal cutting was developed. A simple damage initiation criterion was used, and the damage evolution criterion was coded in the ABAQUS subroutine VUSDFLD. The model can simulate both segmented and continuous chip formation, depending on the experimental configuration, while satisfactorily predicting chip morphology and physical quantities such as temperature, primary shear band and cutting forces. Additionally, a non-negligible material side flow observed experimentally was successfully predicted by simulation. The model accuracy in predicting the material plastic behavior is auspicious for its subsequent extension to the three-dimensional model of SPD processes (i.e., milling, friction stir welding, etc.).},

Process models often target the prediction of fundamental variables such as stresses, strains, strain-rates, temperatures etc. However, to be useful to industry, these variables must be correlated to performance measures: product quality (accuracy, dimensional tolerances, finish, etc.), surface and subsurface integrity, tool-wear, chip-form/breakability, burr formation, machine stability, etc. The adoption of machining models by industry critically depends on the capability of a model to make this link and predict machining performance. Therefore, this paper would identify and discuss several key research topics closely associated with predictive model development for machining operations, primarily targeting industry applications.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 4.0, the process design and development of machining processes poses major challenges for today's manufacturing technology. Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical "trial-and-error" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 \%. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.},

One of the main machining characteristics of titanium alloys is to produce segmented chips for a wide range of cutting speeds and feeds. The present study assumes that the chip segmentation is only induced by adiabatic shear banding, without material failure in the primary shear zone. The new developed model takes into account the influence of strain, strain rate and temperature on the flow stress and also introduces a strain softening effect. The tool chip friction is managed by a combined Coulomb\textendash Tresca friction law. The influence of two different strain softening levels and machining parameters on the cutting forces and chip morphology has been studied.

In the first part of this study, an analytically based computer code combined with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to identify constitutive models for 70MnVS4 and an aluminium-alloyed ultra-high-carbon steel (UHC-steel) from orthogonal milling experiments. In the second part, Oxley's predictive machining theory is coupled with a multi-dexel based material removal model. Contact zone information (width of cut, undeformed chip thickness, rake angle and cutting speed) are calculated for incremental segments on the cutting edge and used as input parameters for force and temperature calculations. Subsequently, process forces are predicted for machining using the inverse determined constitutive models and compared to actual force measurements. The suggested methodology has advantages regarding the computation time compared to finite element analyses.},

To realize a digital twin of the cutting process, an increase of the model reliability of the virtual representation becomes necessary. Thereby, different models are required to represent the experimental behavior of the workpiece material or frictional interactions. One of the most utilized material models is the Johnson\textendash Cook material model. The material model parameters are determined either by conventional or by non-conventional material tests, or inversely from the cutting process. However, the inverse parameter determination, where the model parameters are iteratively modified until a sufficient agreement between experimental and numerical results is reached, is not robust and requires a high number of iterations. In this paper, an approach for the inverse determination of material model parameters based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented. The approach was investigated by the inverse re-identification of an initial parameter set. The conducted investigations showed that a material model parameter set can be determined within a small number of iterations. Thereby, the determined material model parameters resulted in deviations of approximately 1\% in comparison to their target values. It was shown that the PSO is suitable for the inverse material parameter determination from cutting simulations.},

The increasing use of simulation techniques can be attributed to the enhancing computational performance. To accurately model the machining process, different input models are required. Among them, the material model has a crucial impact on the quality of the simulated results. To determine the underlying material model parameters, an inverse procedure has been established, where the material model parameters are adjusted within a chip formation simulation until a reasonable match between simulations and experiments is achieved. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to determine material model parameters inversely from FE-machining simulations by means of the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm. An effect study was conducted to investigate the influence of the initial simplex, the boundary conditions, and the underlying parameters of the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm. Further, the validated procedure has been extended to consider multiple cutting conditions and an adaptive step-size has been implemented into the algorithm. The results of the procedure were validated by re-identification of process observables from the target simulations and it was aimed to re-identify the material model parameters of the target simulations. Based on the algorithm, a robust and systematical method has been developed to determine material model parameters inversely from the machining process.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in numerical modeling of machining processes showing a significant potential for shortening product and process design activities, the broader application of the Finite Element Method (FEM)\textendash based modeling approaches in the manufacturing industry is still limited by the expensive and time-consuming techniques involved in obtaining accurate material flow stress data. This study proposes a new efficient approach consisting of a combined numerical-empirical methodology for inversely identifying the thermomechanical material behavior of AISI 316L stainless steel from machining experiments. In order to establish the work material's flow stress properties under the extreme conditions of machining, the Johnson\textendash Cook (JC) constitutive equation is chosen to consider the impacts of strain, strain-rate, and temperature. Due to the unstable material behavior of AISI 316L stainless steel under certain thermomechanical conditions in the primary shear zone, the calibration of a damage model is integrated into the process for evaluating the flow stress data. The methodology approximates the material constants of the JC relationship by systematically comparing experimentally measured machining results with those predicted equivalents of a 2D implicit FEM process model. The methodology is experimentally verified on AISI 316L stainless steel with respect to cutting forces, chip geometries and temperatures in the tool-chip interface.},

  abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence and increasing high-speed computational performance is still not fully explored in the field of numerical modeling and simulation of machining processes. The efficiency of the numerical model to predict the observables depends on various inputs. The most important and challenging inputs are the material behavior of the work material and the friction conditions during the cutting operation. The parameters of the material model and the friction model have a decisive impact on the simulated results. To reduce the expensive experimentation cost that gives limited data for the parameters, an inverse methodology to identify the parameter values of those inputs is suggested to potentially have data of better quality. This paper introduces a novel approach for the inverse identification of model parameters by implementing the Efficient Global Optimization algorithm. In this work, a method relying on a complete automated Finite Element simulation-based optimization algorithm is implemented to inversely identify the value of the Johnson\textendash Cook (JC) parameters and Coulomb's friction coefficient correlatively, where the objective function is defined as minimizing the error difference between experimental and numerical results. The Ti6Al4V Grade 5 alloy material is considered as a work material, and the identified parameters sets are validated by comparing the simulated results with experimental results. The developed automation process reduces the computation time and eliminating human errors. The identified model parameters value predicts the cutting force as 169 N/mm (2\% deviation from experiments), feed force as 55 N/mm (7\% deviation from experiments), and chip thickness as 0.150 mm (11\% deviation from experiments). Overall, the identified model parameters set improves the prediction accuracy of the finite element model by 32\% compared with the best-identified parameters set in the literature.},

Specific heat capacity and specific electrical resistivity were measured from 250 to 1700 K, thermal diffusivity from 190 to 1530 K, hemispherical total emissivity from 780 to 1670 K, and normal spectral emissivity at 900 nm from 1300 to 1730 K. Thermal conductivity and Lorentz function were computed from experimental data in the range from about 190 to 1530 K. For necessary corrections literature data on thermal linear expansion were used. The results obtained are compared with available literature values.}

A flow stress model based on process dependent parameters such as strain, strain-rate and temperature was used together with a friction model based on shear flow stress of the workpiece at the chip\textendash tool interface. High-speed cutting experiments and process simulations were utilized to determine the unknown parameters in flow stress and friction models. This technique was applied to obtain flow stress for P20 mold steel at hardness of 30 HRC and friction data when using uncoated carbide tooling at high-speed cutting conditions. The average strain, strain-rates and temperatures were computed both in primary (shear plane) and secondary (chip\textendash tool contact) deformation zones. The friction conditions in sticking and sliding regions at the chip\textendash tool interface are estimated using Zorev's stress distribution model. The shear flow stress (kchip) was also determined using computed average strain, strain-rate, and temperatures in secondary deformation zone, while the friction coefficient ({$\mu$}) was estimated by minimizing the difference between predicted and measured thrust forces. By matching the measured values of the cutting forces with the predicted results from FEM simulations, an expression for workpiece flow stress and the unknown friction parameters at the chip\textendash tool contact were determined.},

In this work, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used in a finite element formulation to define the flow law of a metallic material as a function of plastic strain {$\varepsilon$}p, plastic strain rate {$\varepsilon$}.p and temperature T. First, we present the general structure of the neural network, its operation and focus on the ability of the network to deduce, without prior learning, the derivatives of the flow law with respect to the model inputs. In order to validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model, we compare and analyze the performance of several network architectures with respect to the analytical formulation of a Johnson\textendash Cook behavior law for a 42CrMo4 steel. In a second part, after having selected an Artificial Neural Network architecture with 2 hidden layers, we present the implementation of this model in the Abaqus Explicit computational code in the form of a VUHARD subroutine. The predictive capability of the proposed model is then demonstrated during the numerical simulation of two test cases: the necking of a circular bar and a Taylor impact test. The results obtained show a very high capability of the ANN to replace the analytical formulation of a Johnson\textendash Cook behavior law in a finite element code, while remaining competitive in terms of numerical simulation time compared to a classical approach.},

  abstract = {Finite Element Modelling used to predict machining outcomes needs to be supplied with the appropriate material thermomechanical properties which are obtained by specific testing devices and methodologies. However, these tests are usually not representative of the extreme conditions achieved in machining processes and the obtained material law may not be suitable enough. Inverse identification could address this problem by obtaining material thermomechanical properties directly from machining outcomes such as cutting forces, temperatures, strain or strain rates. Nevertheless, this technique needs to be supplied with accurate machining outcomes. However, some of them such as strain or strain rate are difficult to be properly measured. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to measure plastic strain and strain rate during orthogonal machining under plane strain conditions. The main idea is to create a physical microgrid in a workpiece and to analyze the distortion suffered by this grid. The novelty of the method consists on its capability of measuring strain and strain rate fields in a very localized area (primary shear zone) using a single image. The methodology was applied in orthogonal cutting of Ti-6Al-4V under cutting conditions that are representative of the broaching process. Experimental results were compared with DIC measurements, analytical results based on unequal division shear zone model, literature results and with numerical fields obtained from an AdvantEdge-2D model.},

Effects of temperature for the titanium alloy (Ti\textendash 6Al\textendash 4V) are investigated by developing a high temperature SHPB test system. In this work, high temperatures greater than 1000\textdegree C are attained in the SHPB test specimens by using two ellipsoidal radiant heating reflectors with two halogen lamps. The thermal gradients in the specimens are observed as they are heated. Methods for solving problems related to conduction between the specimens and elastic bars and techniques for measuring the temperature of the specimens are suggested. When testing with the high-temperature SHPB apparatus, care is required to prevent oxidation of the surface of the specimen, and to prevent an inhomogeneous temperature distribution from developing in the specimen. To determine the true flow stress\textendash true strain relationship, specimens are tested from room temperature to 1000\textdegree C at intervals of 200\textdegree C and at a strain-rate of 1400s-1.

  abstract = {The plastic behaviour of material can be described using parametric material models such as the Johnson\textendash Cook model. The parameters for such models are identified from experimentally determined flow curves by curve fitting techniques. In high speed machining processes, one encounters strains of more than 200\% and strain rates of the order of 106s-1 or more in the shear zone. The material parameters are determined from experimental data obtained at much milder conditions and thus cannot be reliably used for simulating high speed cutting processes. The Johnson\textendash Cook material model is one of the simplest models with five parameters, which can describe the material behaviour at high temperatures, high strains, and high strain-rates and is often used in machining simulations. It has been shown earlier that multiple sets of Johnson\textendash Cook parameters may be found which can give rise to similar adiabatic stress\textendash strain curves. It has also been shown that by using these parameter sets for the finite element simulation, chip geometry, stress distribution, temperature distribution, and cutting forces are almost identical. In this paper a method for inverse identification of Johnson Cook parameters based on the Levenberg\textendash Marquardt search algorithm is presented. An idealised finite element model for high speed machining is created, using a particular set of Johnson\textendash Cook parameters to describe the material behaviour. The aim of the inverse identification method is to re-identify the original Johnson\textendash Cook parameter set by looking at the chip morphology and the cutting force. In the idealised high speed cutting model, the clearance angle has been assumed to be zero and chip segmentation does not occur.},

The process characteristics of practical relevance are not only the cutting forces and the tool wear, but also the surface layer states of the machined part. In order to predict and to improve these characteristics efficiently, chip forming simulation via finite element method (FEM) is commonly applied. However, an issue in machining simulation which is often addressed is choosing appropriate material parameters for the flow stress model. This especially accounts for AISI4140 with various tempering conditions, as in many cases the precise heat treatment is not supplied in detail, even in scientific literature. In this work, orthogonal cutting of AISI4140 with tempering temperatures of 300\textdegree C, 450\textdegree C and 600\textdegree C is investigated by experiments and FE simulations. The Johnson-Cook flow stress model is used in the FE simulation. The referring material parameters for the tempering conditions are iteratively adapted via numerical optimization to fit experimental cutting forces. The obtained parameters are compared to literature values in order to prepare a common ground for the cutting simulation of AISI4140. This contributes to an enhanced process modelling when machining AISI4140 with use-case adapted heat treatments.},

The formation of stresses at variable tooth feed, but with constant cutting speed and depth of cut is investigated. The development of material modifications (residual stresses) due to multiple stresses was determined and compared with experimental results. Results from the simulation show good accuracy in comparison with the experimentally determined cutting force and active force.
